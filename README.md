# Hi, I'm Adam!

I graduated in 2023 from the University of Illinois at Chicago with a B.S. in Data Science.

My main interests are data analysis and visualization with Python and JavaScript.

In my free time I tinker with hobby electronics and participate as a percussionist in the Lakeside Pride music ensembles.
