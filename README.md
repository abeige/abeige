# Hi, I'm Adam!

I am in my final year of a B.S. in Data Science with a Computer Science concentration at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

My main interests are data analysis and visualization with Python and JavaScript.

## Current Projects:

- [CTA 'L' Ridership Data](https://github.com/abeige/cs424-project3)
- [EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program](https://github.com/abeige/ghgrp)

## About Me

In my free time I tinker with hobby electronics and participate as a percussionist in the Lakeside Pride music ensembles. I am also co-captain of the UIC Robotics drone team (Team Air). This year we are attempting to build an autonomous drone to participate in the [SUAS Competition](https://suas-competition.org) in Maryland for the first time - check out our GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/chicagoedt/team-air-suas-2023)!
