# Hi, I'm Adam!

I am in my final year of a B.S. in Data Science with a Computer Science concentration at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

My main interests are data analysis and visualization with Python. Right now I am working on a project visualizing the spatial-temporal CTA 'L' ridership data.

I'm currently learning SQL in CS 480 at UIC and completing the freeCodeCamp Relational Database certification.

In my free time I tinker with hobby electronics and participate as a percussionist in the Lakeside Pride music ensembles. I am also co-captain of the UIC Robotics drone team. This year we are attempting to build an autonomous drone to participate in the [AUVSI SUAS Competition](https://suas-competition.org) in Maryland for the first time - check out our GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/chicagoedt/team-air)!
