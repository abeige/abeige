# Hi, I'm Adam!

I am in my final year of a B.S. in Data Science with a Computer Science concentration at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

My main interests are data analysis and visualization with Python and JavaScript.

In my free time I tinker with hobby electronics and participate as a percussionist in the Lakeside Pride music ensembles. I am also co-captain of the UIC Robotics drone team (EDT Team Air). This year we are building an autonomous drone to participate in the [SUAS Competition 2023](https://suas-competition.org) in Maryland for the first time.
